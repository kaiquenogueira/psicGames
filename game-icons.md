# Game Icons Revamp

🎨 **DESIGN COMMITMENT (ANTI-SAFE HARBOR):**
- **Selected Radical Style**: Brutalist 3D Geometry
- **Why this style?** → Breaks the typical "soft/friendly" healthcare cliché for cognitive games. Uses sharp edges, high contrast, and aggressive bold visuals to promote focus, energy, and a premium "gaming" feel rather than a clinical one.
- **Risk Factor**: Sharp edges and high-contrast aggressive palettes (Acid Green, Signal Orange, Deep Red) instead of safe, calming blues and purples. Eliminates the standard rounded-full borders for these icons.
- **Modern Cliché Scan**: No glassmorphism, no mesh gradients, no soft bento grids.
- **Palette**: High Contrast Black/Charcoal with Acid Green, Neon Orange, Deep Red, Teal, Yellow. NO PURPLE.
